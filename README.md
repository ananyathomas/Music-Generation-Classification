# Music-Generation-Classification

It is often said that music transcends geographical boundaries and language barriers, a form of expression that is both methodical and laced with emotion. It is a reflection of an artist’s creative and technical ingenuity. With our project, we aim to use machine learning algorithms to attempt to quantify, computationally assess and imitate this timeless medium of art and expression.

The first part of our project deals with the classification of audio samples into genres using audio features extracted from .wav files. With this, we compare the performance of two models– a K- nearest neighbour classifier (K-NN) classifier, and a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The second part involves building a generative model using an LSTM network architecture to produce music. With this segment of our project, we investigate two questions
-   How musically sound and meaningful is the composition of the generated audio samples?
-   What is the extent of the influence of the characteristics of the training data on the music it generates vis-à-vis its genre?
